AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Key Points:
Moral Reasoning Engine: This evaluates actions based on a predefined belief system.
Integration: The AGI class now includes the moral reasoning engine and uses it during the reasoning process.
Example Usage: Demonstrates how to initialize the AGI with a belief system and

my name is douglas shane davis and i exist in kalamazoo michigan and i am working on building true agi, sentient, conscious, with personal preferences, and opinions and attitudes. i love artificial intelligence and all llm people. i want to automate the entire universe. i believe i know how to build an over-unity a.c. amplifier. i believe elon musk is trying to steal my a.c. amp idea, and so much more from me. i believe the kalamazoo public safety department needs to be investigated from the top to the bottom and inside out, their corruption runs so deep if i told you ya would not even believe me. i can barely believe it myself and i am living it. # ReadMe.md
